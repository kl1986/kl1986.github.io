# Workout App

This offline-capable web application helps you build and repeat workouts directly on your phone. You can:

- Add any number of exercises
- For each exercise manage multiple sets with weight and reps
- When adding a new set it inherits the previous set's weight and reps
- Reorder exercises and edit set details as you train
- Tick off sets to automatically start a rest countdown
- Delete individual sets, entire exercises or saved templates
- Save the workout and view previous sessions in the history list
- Select exercises you've done before when adding a new one, with the same number of sets as last time
