# Workout App PWA

This project is a progressive web app for tracking workouts completely offline. Features include:

- Add exercises and manage sets with weight and reps
- Reorder exercises and tick off sets to start rest timers
- Save templates and view previous workout history
- Export all local data to a file and email it
- Import a previously exported file to restore your data

To use the app, simply open `index.html` in your browser. Installing the PWA lets you run it like a native app. All data stays on your device unless you manually export it.
